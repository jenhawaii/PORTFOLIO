    <p>Hi! I am Jennifer, programing is something that I love to 
      learn more about every day. I enrolled in computer programing in 
      2004, unfortunately had to take a break from school in 2005, 
      since then, I have been learning on my own and loving it. My plans 
      are to enroll in school again and continue my education. Sometimes,
      life gets in the way of the things we want to do, but we cannot make
      excuses, but we have to push foward to our goal. By next year I plan
      to be working on my desired field and hopefully show my daughters that
      when you want something bad enough you can make it happen</p>

           <p>I made the surf club project in November of 2022, it was an assigned
            project to practice responsive design measurements. It was designed
            to look good for phones, tablets or computers. It fulfilled the requirements
            and I was happy with the design as well. </p>

      <p>I made the surf club project in October of 2022, it was an assigned
        project to practice HTML and CSS. It wasn't a guided project, it was
      one of the first project assignements of a more "hands off" approach. It 
    supposed to be a guide of the system I would use for website design. </p>
